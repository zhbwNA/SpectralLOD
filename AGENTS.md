# DDM-FEM-Helmholtz-Maxwell Project

## MATLAB Execution

- **Always run MATLAB silently**: use `-nosplash -nodesktop -batch` — no console windows.
- **Never use `-noFigureWindows`** unless the user explicitly asks to suppress all graphics. Experiment figures must display.
- For running a script: `matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -batch "addpath(genpath('.')); run('script.m');"`
- For running inline code: `matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -batch "addpath(genpath('.')); <code>;"`
- Check for MATLAB at `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2023a\bin\matlab.exe` first, then fall back to `matlab` on PATH.

## HPC Rules (Workstation: 48 cores, 549 GB RAM)

- **Ask permission before any test estimated to use >200 GB memory.** Estimate memory usage and present it before running.
- **Use `parfor` for subdomain setup.** Start parpool before large runs: `parpool('local', feature('numcores'))`.
- **Vectorize all assembly.** Use iFEM-style one-shot `sparse(ii, jj, ss, N, N)`.
- **Avoid `containers.Map` with string keys for large meshes.** Use `ismember` on sorted edge lists or sparse hashing.
- **Memory estimation rule of thumb** for 2D Helmholtz with N nodes, NT elements, nSub subdomains:
  - Global sparse matrix A: ~7N nonzeros × 16 bytes (complex) ≈ 112N bytes
  - Edge list: ~6NT entries × 8 bytes ≈ 48NT bytes
  - Per subdomain (N/nSub nodes): ~3 × 7×N/nSub nonzeros × 8 bytes (real) + LU ≈ 500×(N/nSub)^1.5 bytes
  - Total ≈ 112N + 48NT + nSub × (170N/nSub + 500(N/nSub)^1.5) bytes

## MATLAB Figure Quality

- **Always use LaTeX interpreter** for titles, labels, legends: `'Interpreter', 'latex'`
- Use `$...$` for inline math: `title('$\kappa(M^{-1}A)$ vs $H/\delta$', 'Interpreter', 'latex')`
- Use `\partial`, `\Omega`, `\Gamma`, `\alpha`, `\delta`, `\kappa`, `\rho` etc.
- Set `'Interpreter', 'latex'` on: `title()`, `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, `legend()`, `text()`
- Use `\setminus` for set difference: `$\partial\Omega_i \setminus \partial\Omega$`

## iFEM Coding Style (Chen Long)

This project follows the sparse matrixlization style from Long Chen's iFEM package:

- **Assemble in one shot** — Build `(ii, jj, ss)` index/value vectors across all elements, then call `sparse(ii, jj, ss, N, N)` once. Never loop over elements assigning into a sparse matrix.
- **Vectorize across elements** — Use element-wise array operations (`.`, `.*`, `./`). Element geometry (area, gradients) is computed once for all elements.
- **Pre-allocate index arrays** — `ii = zeros(nEntries,1); jj = zeros(nEntries,1); ss = zeros(nEntries,1); idx = 0;` — fill in blocks, then truncate.
- **Struct-based API** — Geometry in `mesh` struct (`node`, `elem`, `bdFlag`, `area`, `edge`). PDE data in `pde` struct (`coef`, `source`, `dirichlet`, `neumann`).
- **Function naming** — `assembleXxx` for matrix assembly, `camelCase` for utilities. No underscores in function names (MATLAB convention).
- **One short doc line** — One comment line above the function stating the mathematical formula. No verbose docstrings.
- **Use built-in `sparse` summation** — Duplicate `(i,j)` entries are automatically summed by `sparse`, so you can write the same `(i,j)` pair multiple times and get the accumulated value.

## Numerical Coding Discipline

These rules adapt the coding principles in `Karpathy's CLAUDE.md` to this FEM/DDM MATLAB project.

### Think Before Coding

- State the mathematical interpretation before implementation: PDE, weak form, finite element space, boundary conditions, and matrix/operator form.
- If a paper, existing code path, or user instruction is ambiguous, ask before coding. Do not fill gaps with plausible numerical-analysis folklore.
- Surface important tradeoffs early: paper fidelity vs. memory, direct LU vs. iterative solve, exact table parameters vs. scaled verification.
- For DDM work, clarify the geometry and interface conditions before writing partition or solver code.

### Simplicity First

- Implement the smallest paper-faithful component that can be verified.
- Do not add general frameworks, unused options, or speculative solver modes unless required by the paper or requested by the user.
- Prefer extending existing assembly, mesh, quadrature, partition, and preconditioner utilities over adding parallel versions.
- If a verification script becomes broad or slow, split focused checks from paper-scale reproduction instead of mixing them.

### Surgical Changes

- Touch only the files needed for the requested method, reproduction, or verification.
- Preserve existing MATLAB style: vectorized iFEM-style assembly, one-shot `sparse(ii,jj,ss,...)`, camelCase utilities, short formula comments.
- Do not refactor unrelated code while implementing a paper method. Mention unrelated issues separately.
- Remove only unused code introduced by the current change; do not clean up pre-existing dead code unless asked.

### Goal-Driven Verification

For each implementation/reproduction phase, define success criteria before running:

1. Formulation extraction -> verify: equations and algorithm steps cite the paper section/equation/table.
2. Matrix translation -> verify: dimensions, DOF sets, restrictions, local operators, and boundary terms are explicit.
3. Implementation -> verify: focused numerical checks pass on small meshes.
4. Paper reproduction -> verify: generated table is compared directly against the paper table.
5. Closeout -> verify: scripts live in `verify/`, debug helpers in `debug/`, and deviations from the paper are documented.

A task is complete only when the result table answers the reproduction question: consistent with the paper, inconsistent, or blocked by a clearly stated limitation.

## Reuse-First Principle

Before writing any new function:
1. **Grep** the codebase for existing utilities that already do the job or can be extended.
2. **Check** `verify/` for existing test patterns to reuse.
3. **Use** existing mesh utilities (`edgeMesh2D`, `edgeMesh3D`, `faceMesh3D`, `extendMesh2D`, `extendMesh3D`, `quadtriangle`, `quadtet`).
4. **Use** existing basis evaluators (`lagrange2D`, `lagrange3D`, `nedelec1_2D`, `nedelec1_3D`, `nedelec2_2D`, `nedelec2_3D`).
5. **Prefer extending** an existing function over creating a new one alongside it.
6. **Do not reimplement** quadrature, basis gradients, or mesh topology — they already exist.

## Research Subagents

- **Use `math-searcher`** (`.claude/agents/math-searcher.md`) when a request needs internet literature search, article extraction, or implementation search for DDM, FEM, Helmholtz, or Maxwell topics.
- Give `math-searcher` a bounded target: method names, equations/sections to extract, desired source type (paper, arXiv, code, documentation), and implementation language if relevant.
- `math-searcher` should prioritize primary sources, return URLs/DOIs/arXiv IDs, extract only the requested formulas or algorithm details, and state how each result maps to this MATLAB codebase.
- Do not treat internet summaries as implementation authority. Convert any extracted formulation into this project's notation and verify locally before coding.

## Paper Reproduction Workflow

Use this workflow whenever the user asks to **reproduce**, **replicate**, or **match** experiments from a paper.

- **Goal first:** the goal is not to improve the method, tune aggressively, or make a new benchmark. The goal is to determine whether this repo can produce tables/figures consistent with the paper.
- **Extract before coding:** use `math-searcher` when needed to find the paper, preprint, author implementation, supplementary material, or related code. Extract the exact algorithm, PDE, boundary conditions, discretization, stopping rules, reported metrics, and table/figure parameters.
- **Translate to matrices:** use `math-translator` when needed to convert the paper formulation into this repo's matrix notation: global operator, local subdomain operators, restriction/prolongation, partition of unity, coarse space, transmission terms, and solver iteration.
- **Parameter sheet required:** write the paper parameters into a concrete experiment form before running:
  - domain and boundary conditions
  - PDE coefficients, wavenumber/frequency, material parameters
  - mesh size `h`, subdomain size `H`, overlap `delta`, polynomial degree, quadrature
  - number/type of subdomains, partition geometry, coarse space
  - solver, preconditioner, tolerance, max iterations, restart/damping
  - reported paper table/figure target values
- **Strict alignment:** match the paper unless a project rule or HPC rule prevents it. Do not silently replace algorithms, boundary conditions, solvers, partitioning, or parameters with convenient alternatives.
- **HPC exception:** if exact paper parameters are estimated to exceed the active HPC permission threshold or are otherwise unsafe, stop and report the memory estimate. Propose the closest scaled experiment separately and label it as scaled, not reproduced.
- **Comparison report:** every reproduction run should end with a compact table comparing `paper value`, `repo value`, `relative/absolute difference`, and `notes`. State whether the result is consistent, partially consistent, or inconsistent.
- **No hidden tuning:** if extra tuning is needed to match the paper, document it as a deviation. Keep the paper-faithful run as the baseline.

## Git Commit Policy

- **Commit when a phase is complete and verified** — After writing a component and its verification passes, commit immediately. Don't batch unrelated changes.
- **Document genuine bugs in commit messages** — When a non-obvious bug was encountered and fixed during development, describe it in the commit body:
  - What the symptom was (wrong output, crash, assertion failure)
  - The root cause (sign error, indexing mistake, missing edge case)
  - How the fix resolves it
  - Format:
    ```
    Fix NE_2: higher-order edge DOF sign parity

    Bug: interior DOF sign was not set to 1, causing sign flips on
    elements with reversed edges via gSign propagation.
    Root cause: gSign(:, 7:8) was left as zeros instead of ones.
    Fix: set gSign(:, 7:8) = 1 after the edge-DOF loop.
    ```
- **Do NOT commit** half-finished work or code that hasn't been verified.

## File Organization

After completing a phase, organize new files into their appropriate folders. Create new folders as needed.

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/Assembly/Lagrange/` | Scalar Lagrange FE assembly routines |
| `src/Assembly/Nedelec/` | Nedelec FE assembly routines |
| `src/FE/Lagrange/` | Lagrange basis and mesh-extension utilities |
| `src/FE/Nedelec/` | Nedelec basis, orientation, and DOF utilities |
| `src/Utils/` | Mesh, quadrature, transfer, and other auxiliary utilities |
| `src/DDM/` | Domain decomposition partitioning and solver routines |
| `src/Preconditioners/` | AS/OAS/ORAS preconditioner builders |
| `verify/` | Numerical verification and test scripts (`verify_*.m`) |
| `debug/` | One-off debugging and investigation scripts (`debug_*.m`) |
| `.claude/agents/` | Project sub-agent definitions such as `math-searcher` |
| `.claude/skills/` | Project Claude skills and migrated command helpers |
| `.agents/skills/` | Project Codex skills and source-command wrappers |
| `.Codex/` | Codex configuration (skills, commands, hooks) |

- **Test scripts always go in `verify/`** — e.g., `verify/verify_ned2_2D.m`.
- **Debug/investigation scripts always go in `debug/`** — e.g., `debug/debug_cond.m`.
- **Create a new subfolder under `src/`** when a logical group of library files warrants it.
- **Never leave standalone scripts at root** — they belong in `verify/`, `debug/`, or a topic folder.

## DDM: Overlap Parameter Rule

- **δ must be an integer multiple of h** (δ = k·h, k ∈ ℕ) unless explicitly specified otherwise.
- This ensures subdomain boundaries align with mesh edges, producing straight (non-zig-zag) interfaces on structured meshes.
- Applies to both strip and checkerboard partitions in all dimensions.

## DDM: Mathematical Formulation

### Spaces

| Space | Definition | Boundary Condition |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Fine space V_h | P1 FEM on uniform mesh of size h, dim ≈ h^{-d} | u=0 on ∂Ω |
| Subdomain Ω_i (ASM) | Overlapping: elements with centroid x ∈ [a+(i-1)H-δ, a+iH+δ] | u=0 on ∂Ω_i (Dirichlet inner BC) |
| Subdomain Ω_i^0 (OSM) | Non-overlapping: elements with centroid x ∈ [a+(i-1)H, a+iH) | Robin on Γ_{ij} |
| Interior nodes V_{h,i} | Nodes where ALL incident elements ∈ Ω_i | Free DOFs for subdomain solve |

### ASM (Additive Schwarz) — Overlapping, Dirichlet inner BC

M^{-1} = Σ_i R_i^T A_i^{-1} R_i

- R_i: V_h → V_{h,i} — restricts global free DOFs to interior free DOFs of Ω_i
- A_i = R_i A R_i^T — extracted from global stiffness (no re-assembly needed)
- V_{h,i} = {v ∈ V_h|_{Ω_i} : v = 0 on ∂Ω_i} — Dirichlet on artificial boundaries
- κ(M^{-1}A) ~ O(1 + H/δ), independent of h
- **Overlap is ESSENTIAL**: without overlap (δ=0), Dirichlet inner BC makes subdomains disconnected → κ→∞

### OSM (Optimized Schwarz) — Non-overlapping, Robin transmission

- ∂u_i/∂n_i + α u_i = ∂u_j/∂n_i + α u_j on Γ_{ij}
- Robin term: α·M_Γ added to stiffness, M_Γ·g added to RHS
- Flux from neighbor: g(k) = b_j(k) - (A_j u_j)(k) + α u_j(k)
- Optimal α ≈ 0.5·π/H (empirically)
- ρ independent of h, degrades as H→0: ρ→1 without coarse space

### Key Findings

1. **ASM-PCG is effective across all dimensions** (3–17 iterations with proper overlap)
2. **Overlap δ > 0 is essential** for ASM with Dirichlet inner BC — without overlap the preconditioned system becomes singular (subdomains disconnected at shared boundaries)
3. **κ is independent of h**, depends on H/δ ratio — confirmed in 1D/2D/3D
4. **OSM converges in 1D** (ρ≈0.15 with optimal α) but **fails in 2D/3D** (ρ→1) without a coarse space
5. **One-level OSM is not viable in 2D/3D** — a two-level method with coarse space is required

### Run DDM extension study (checkerboard, overlapping OSM, coarse space)

```bash
matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -batch "addpath(genpath('.')); run('verify/verify_ddm_extension.m');"
```

5-table study on 2D Poisson:
- Table 1: ASM strip vs checkerboard (κ, PCG iters)
- Table 2: OSM strip vs checkerboard (ρ, iters)
- Table 3: Overlapping OSM δ-effect (ρ vs δ, α)
- Table 4: Two-level ASM with coarse space
- Table 5: Two-level OSM with coarse space

**Extension Results Summary:**
- Checkerboard partitioning works with ASM (κ slightly higher than strips for same element count)
- Overlapping OSM: δ=0.16 gives ρ=0.04 (6 iters), vs ρ=0.94 (fails) for non-overlapping. Overlap dramatically improves OSM.
- Two-level OSM: P1 coarse H=1/6 gives ρ=0.17 (9 iters), vs ρ=0.996 (fails) for one-level. Coarse space transforms OSM from useless to practical in 2D.
- Two-level ASM: additive coarse correction increases κ when fine preconditioner is already strong. Multiplicative/hybrid needed for benefit.
- P2 DDM: requires special DOF classification (vertex vs edge interior/boundary) — open problem.

## ORAS for Helmholtz (Gong-Gander-Graham-Spence 2021/2022)

### Mathematical Formulation

Helmholtz with impedance BC: `-(Δ + k²)u = f`, `∂u/∂n - iku = g` on ∂Ω.

Sesquilinear form: `a(u,v) = ∫_Ω(∇u·∇v̄ - k²uv̄)dx - ik∫_{∂Ω}uv̄ ds`

ORAS preconditioner: `B_h^{-1} = Σ_j R̃_{h,j} A_{h,j}^{-1} R_{h,j}`

- `R_{h,j}`: restriction (by duality)
- `R̃_{h,j}`: weighted prolongation = `R_{h,j}(I_h(χ_j · v))` — multiply local solution by partition of unity χ_j before extending
- `A_{h,j}`: local Helmholtz with impedance BC on ALL of ∂Ω_j
- χ_j(node) = 1/(#subdomains containing node)

GMRES is the preferred global solver (non-Hermitian A). Richardson needs strong damping.

### Usage: ORAS with adjustable k, h, delta, and solver mode

```matlab
% ---- Parameters -----------------------------------------------------------
k     = 20;                   % wavenumber
h     = 2/(10*k);             % mesh size (h*k = 0.2 for P1 resolution)
delta = 1/4;                  % overlap extension per side (physical distance)
nSub  = 8;                    % number of strip subdomains
% For checkerboard: nSub = [nx, ny], e.g. [5, 5]

% ---- Mesh -----------------------------------------------------------------
[node, elem, bd] = squaremesh([0, 16/3, 0, 1], h);  % strip domain
% [node, elem, bd] = squaremesh([0, 1, 0, 1], h);    % checkerboard domain

% ---- Manufactured solution: u = sin(pi x) sin(pi y) -----------------------
u_ex = @(x,y) sin(pi*x) .* sin(pi*y);
f    = @(x,y) (2*pi^2 - k^2) * u_ex(x,y);
g    = @(x,y) 0;              % impedance BC: du/dn - iku = g

% ---- Global Helmholtz assembly -------------------------------------------
[A, b] = assembleHelmholtz2D(node, elem, bd, k, f, g);

% ---- Partition ------------------------------------------------------------
parts = partitionMesh2D(node, elem, bd, nSub, 'overlap', delta);

% ---- Build ORAS preconditioner -------------------------------------------
% solverMode: 'lu' (default, fast iterations, more memory — may exceed RAM)
%             'direct' — A\b each iteration via UMFPACK, less memory
applyPrecon = orasHelmholtz(node, elem, bd, k, parts, 1, 'direct');

% ---- Solve with Richardson iteration -------------------------------------
u = zeros(size(A,1), 1);
for it = 1:200
    r = b - A * u;
    u = u + applyPrecon(r);
    if norm(r)/norm(b) < 1e-6, break; end
end
% ---- Or solve with GMRES -------------------------------------------------
% [u, flag, relres, iter] = gmres(A, b, [], 1e-6, 200, applyPrecon);
```

**Parameter guide:**
| Param | Description | Typical value |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `k` | Wavenumber | 20 (h=0.01), 40 (h=0.005), etc. |
| `h` | Mesh size | `2/(10*k)` for h·k=0.2 resolution |
| `delta` | Overlap per side | `1/4` for strips, `H/4` for checkerboard |
| `nSub` | Subdomain count | Scalar→strips, `[nx,ny]`→checkerboard |
| `degree` | FE order | 1 (P1), 2 (P2 experimental) |
| `solverMode` | Subdomain solver | `'lu'` (fast, high memory), `'direct'` (backslash, low memory) |
| `useParfor` | Parallel subdomain setup | `false` (default), `true` (needs active `parpool`) |

**Solver mode comparison:**
| Mode | Peak memory | Per-iteration speed | When to use |
|------|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `'lu'` | High (LU fill-in can be 10-100× matrix size) | Fast (forward/back substitution) | Small/medium problems, enough RAM |
| `'direct'` | Low (stores only A_j, no factors) | Slower (UMFPACK each iteration) | Large 2D/3D problems, HPC |

### Run overlapping OSM comprehensive study

```bash
matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -batch "addpath(genpath('.')); run('verify/verify_ddm_osm_overlap.m');"
```

Shows partition diagrams first, then 4 tables:
- Table 1: Overlapping OSM — δ effect for strip partitions (nSub=2,3,4)
- Table 2: Overlapping OSM — δ effect for checkerboard (2×2, 3×3)
- Table 3: Overlapping OSM — α sensitivity scan (best δ=H/2)
- Table 4: Two-level overlapping OSM — coarse + overlap combined (strip + checkerboard)

Generates diagrams:
- `fig_osm_strip_overlap.png` — strip non-overlap vs overlap comparison
- `fig_osm_checkerboard_overlap.png` — checkerboard 2×2 and 3×3 with overlap

### Show subdomain boundaries (zig-zag visualization)

```bash
matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -batch "addpath(genpath('.')); run('verify/plot_subdomain_boundaries.m');"
```

Generates `verify/fig_smooth_boundaries.png` — 3 panels contrasting zig-zag vs straight boundaries:
- δ not aligned with mesh → zig-zag
- δ = h → straight vertical boundaries
- δ = 2h → straight, wider overlap
- **Rule:** choose δ = k·h (integer multiple of mesh size) for straight subdomain boundaries on structured meshes.
